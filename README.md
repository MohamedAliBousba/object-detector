# Object Detector 

This project aims to build an object detection application using the COCO SSD model with TensorFlow.js. The application will be able to detect and classify multiple objects in an image. The COCO SSD model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which contains a wide variety of objects in various contexts, making it suitable for general object detection tasks.
